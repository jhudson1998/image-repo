THOUGHTS
-comments? likes?
-photos stored with an integer (1 for first photo)
-photos showed in chronological order with 10 per page(arrows to navigate pages)
-settings page including option to delete account and associated photos (what else?)
-do I have to store photos when retrieved from server or can I display them as soon as they are retrieved from the server
    (prefer to display them dynamically)
-would prefer to have search functionality match usernames close to search but probably will have to externally source it
-select password/change focus when failed login for ease of password retyping
-can I change the speed of the scroll bar(currently far too slow)
-setPreferredSize creates padding around photos smaller than the size, can I get rid of that to create even padding between all photos?
    -> could show smaller icons(?) that expand into full sized photos when clicked
    -> how would I create a clean UI with that? brainstorm layouts


CURRENT TASKS
-browse files and select one using GUI
-upload work flow: send photo to server, store in users folder, update database, refresh photo feed in homeUI
    (always revert to newest 10 photos)

FUTURE TASKS
-home button brings user back to page 1 of photos
-show text with each buttons features on hover


-MAKE FEED PHOTOS A MAX WIDTH OF 960
-can be any height

-for loop for the current 10 photos to check and/or change their size to fit on feed
